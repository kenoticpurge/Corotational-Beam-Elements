Regarding Spatial Beam Elements, only static cases are considered.

The Spatial Corotational Beam Element formulation can be found in the paper: "Co-rotational beam elements with warping eï¬€ects
in instability problems"

The incremental rotation formulation described in Section 3.5.2 of the paper is used.

Warping effects are not considered in these codes.
