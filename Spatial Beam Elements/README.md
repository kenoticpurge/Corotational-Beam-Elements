Regarding Spatial Beam Elements, only static cases are considered.

The Spatial Corotational Beam Element formulation can be found in the paper: "Co-rotational beam elements with warping eï¬€ects
in instability problems"

There are two codes you can run. Both codes use a different parameterisation for the finite rotations which are discussed in Section 3.5 of the above paper.

Warping effects are not considered in these codes.
